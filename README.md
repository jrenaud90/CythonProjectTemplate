# Cython Project Template
A simple project file structure to quickly ramp-up a new Cython project.

Contributions are welcome.

## What you should change right away:
- Update the `LICENSE.md` to match your project's needs.
- Update `pyproject.toml` with your project & author information, dependencies, etc.
- Change the directory `CythonProjectTemplate` to match the name of your package.
- Read through `.github\workflows\build_wheels_main_pypi.yml` and make the necessary changes.
- `.gitignore` was configured with Cython, Python, C, C++, in mind. Also it has VSCode IDE specific file ignores. You may need to edit for your needs.
